# 🚀 7 Day DevOps Challenge – Day #1

Wow, that's **Day #1** of the **7 Day DevOps Challenge** done!  
I just kickstarted a **Java web app hosted on AWS**. 🎉  

---

## ✅ What I Did
- Launched an **EC2 instance** on AWS.
- Set up a **remote SSH connection** to my EC2 instance using **VSCode**.
- Generated a **basic Java web app structure** with **Apache Maven**.

---

## 🌟 Highlight of the Day
The best part was **integrating VSCode with EC2** to create a powerful cloud-based IDE for development.  
It felt like coding directly on a virtual machine while keeping the convenience of VSCode.

## 📖 Documentation
I’ve written a step-by-step guide on how you can replicate this setup.

Huge thanks 🙏 to **@NextWork** for their excellent guides and for hosting the **7 Day DevOps Challenge**.

## 🔥 What’s Next
Stay tuned!  
**Day #2** will be all about **connecting GitHub with my AWS architecture**.
