# AWS Projects Challenge - Day #1

That's Day #1 of my AWS Projects Challenge done!  
Today I hosted my very own static website on Amazon S3:  
✅ Created and configured an Amazon S3 bucket, complete with ACLs, versioning, and public access.  
✅ Uploaded website content, diving deep into how static websites function and how to host them on S3.  
✅ Tackled public access settings and fixed an interesting challenge with the website's visibility.  

📸 See my journey from creating buckets to deploying a fully functional static website in my [documentation](#).  

📢 Shoutout to all AWS learners—let's connect, share tips, and keep improving!
